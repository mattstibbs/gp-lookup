# GP Lookup

A small experiment in building a GP lookup that's simple to use.

## Setup

### Docker (option 1)

Make sure you have Docker and compose installed for your operating system
then run:

```bash
docker build -t <tag_name> .
```

Starting up the server:

```bash
docker run -t -p 9292:9292 gp-lookup
```

After run the server, you can go http://localhost:9292 on browser.

### Local Environment (option 2)

Getting started:

 - Install Ruby 2.2.3
 - `bundle install`

Starting up the server:

    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000 bundle exec rackup

##Â Usage

The only endpoint is `/practices`. You can search by including a query
parameter: `/practices?search=lake+side`.

## Updating data

Get new data from the [general-medical-practices][practices] and
[general-medical-practitioners][practitioners] repos:
